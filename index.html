            I have been unable to open Coursera website on Firefox for a long time now. At least 3 years. Maybe 5+ years. Nah, I don&rsquo;t remember since when exactly. It just showed the page with this text:
Sorry, we are down for maintenance. We will be back up shortly. Many quick searches on Google didn&rsquo;t show anything, so there are probably not many people experiencing this issue. I&rsquo;ve tried disabling all add-ons, but it didn&rsquo;t work either.

            This is about having a development environment where you can build and run programs without installing the necessary compilers in your system directly. More specifically, the compilers will run inside containers, which in our case here will be built and run with Buildah and Podman. You can use Docker too if you want.
The cool kids are doing Rust now, so let&rsquo;s use that for the example. Since this post is mostly about Buildah and Podman, I&rsquo;ll assume that Rust/Cargo is already set up properly in your system.

            Whereabouts of Light, or 星の在り処 (hoshi no arika), is the ending song of Trails in the Sky FC. There will be spoilers in this post, you have been warned.
Players get to hear this song in many places in Sky. From the initial opening scene of Sky FC, somewhere in mid-game of both Sky FC and SC, the full song at the end of Sky FC, and hell, even the tune you hear when the &lsquo;Falcom&rsquo; logo is shown when you boot up the Sky FC game is actually part of the full song.

            All these were taken from here. I only made minor adjustments to the formatting. My comments about this song are here.
君の影星のように　朝に溶けて消えていく 行き先を失くしたまま　想いは溢れてくる kimi no kage hoshi no you ni asa ni tokete kiete yuku ikisaki wo nakushita mama omoi wa afuretekuru Your shadow, like the stars, will dissolve into the morning sky and disappear. I have lost your whereabouts, but my thoughts of you are overflowing. 強さにも弱さにも　この心は向き合えた 君とならどんな明日が　来ても怖くないのに tsuyosa ni mo yowasa ni mo kono kokoro wa mukiaeta kimi to nara donna ashita ga kite mo kowakunai noni My heart was able to face both strength and weakness.

            I recently finished playing The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky games (英雄伝説 空の軌跡).
I finished all the obvious quests (those on the job board and all the doors in the 3rd), but I didn&rsquo;t 100% the game. Oh well.
My play time according to Steam:
FC: 36 hours SC: 45 hours 3rd: 45 hours My play time according to the game itself, which is different from the real time because of the in-game speedups:

            I decided to write this after facing the surprisingly annoying process of installing various packages for machine learning purposes.
Let&rsquo;s start from the beginning. Create an environment on anaconda:
conda create -n pytorch-env python=3 Switch to the pytorch-env environment:
conda activate pytorch-env Install PyTorch according to the official documentation. Notice that it includes cpuonly instead of cudatoolkit. This means that there will be no CUDA support, which is intentional because I&rsquo;m doing this in a VM.

            Synology Router Manager (SRM) is the name of web interface to manage your Synology Router RT2600ac device. For me, my SRM address is configured as http://router.synology.com:8000/webman/index.cgi.
Recently, when I opened it on Firefox, I got an error page saying something like this:
An error occurred during a connection to router.synology.com:8000. PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR I was able to open it just fine on Chrome, so it seemed that Firefox screwed up somewhere.
Upon further examination, I noticed that on Firefox, I was redirected to HTTPS, so I was actually visiting https://router.

            I updated my Arch VM with the usual command:
pacman -Syu Then, upon rebooting the VM, after logging-in again, the desktop environment would only show a black screen. I was still able to bring up tty2 with Ctrl + Alt + F2, so it seemed like other than the desktop environment, the VM was running just fine.
After some debugging, I suspected that virtualbox-guest-utils package was the culprit. Checking through the update log, it seemed like that package was indeed updated:
