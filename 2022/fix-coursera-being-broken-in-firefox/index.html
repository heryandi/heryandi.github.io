            <p>I have been unable to open Coursera website on Firefox for a long time now.
At least 3 years. Maybe 5+ years. Nah, I don&rsquo;t remember since when exactly.
It just showed the page with this text:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Sorry, we are down for maintenance.
We will be back up shortly.
</code></pre><p>Many quick searches on Google didn&rsquo;t show anything, so there are probably not many people experiencing this issue.
I&rsquo;ve tried disabling all add-ons, but it didn&rsquo;t work either.</p>
<p>The website works just fine in Chrome, which makes sense of course, since that&rsquo;s the most widely used browser now, but breaking the entire website for Firefox sounded way too sloppy for Coursera.</p>
<p>Their website is quite technically difficult after all: Many different courses, videos, assignment submissions, etc.
For them to fail to support Firefox entirely didn&rsquo;t sound right.</p>
<p>I personally had been using Chrome for Coursera for a very long time to avoid this issue. After many years of that, I finally decided to take a closer look. I had a big hint, after all: It works fine in Chrome.</p>
<p>So&hellip; I couldn&rsquo;t even load the home page with Firefox, which should be just basic GET requests.
What was the raw HTTP header response returned? Here you go:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>HTTP/2 500 Internal Server Error
content-type: text/html
content-length: 1020
date: Tue, 28 Jun 2022 13:09:22 GMT
x-cache: Error from cloudfront
via: 1.1 51840d06a8ec9d04d9a07458d05eb7ce.cloudfront.net (CloudFront)
x-amz-cf-pop: NRT12-C4
x-amz-cf-id: vN4DPF4IGSgbTNayll-1asw_NWhOasFrurqOVjtIcY2BJwWcRA3w1w==
X-Firefox-Spdy: h2
</code></pre><p>Not helpful. I tried Google the <code>Error from cloudfront</code> part too, but nothing interesting showed up.
Maybe the most helpful part of that was the fact that it&rsquo;s error 500. Gee, thanks.
If it&rsquo;s actually purely the server&rsquo;s fault, I would expect more complaints of this to be found in Google.</p>
<p>Something with the request headers maybe? Let&rsquo;s look there. Here is the one sent by Firefox:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>GET / HTTP/2
Host: www.coursera.org
User-Agent: &lt;redacted&gt;
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en,en-US;q=0.7,chrome://global/locale/intl.properties;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Connection: keep-alive

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
Sec-Fetch-Dest: document
Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate
Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site
TE: trailers
</code></pre><p>I can&rsquo;t tell immediately what is wrong. Can you do better?</p>
<p>Anyway, what about Chrome? Here it is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>:authority: www.coursera.org
:method: GET
:path: /
:scheme: https
accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.9

sec-ch-ua: &lt;redacted&gt;

sec-ch-ua-platform: &#34;Windows&#34;
sec-fetch-dest: document
sec-fetch-mode: navigate
sec-fetch-site: same-origin
sec-fetch-user: ?1
upgrade-insecure-requests: 1
user-agent: &lt;redacted&gt;
</code></pre><p>Okay, a few headers are different, of course.
Here is my list of suspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>user-agent</li>
<li>accept</li>
<li>accept-language</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s copy-paste the value sent by Chrome one-by-one and resend the HTTP request from Firefox.
To do this on Firefox: Open up Web Developer Tools, Network tab, right-click on the failing request, then choose <code>Edit and Resend</code>.</p>
<p>&hellip;and voila, <code>accept-language</code> is the problem.
What&rsquo;s wrong with the value sent by Firefox?</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Accept-Language: en,en-US;q=0.7,chrome://global/locale/intl.properties;q=0.3
</code></pre><p>With just this, that <code>chrome://global/locale/intl.properties</code> stuff looks suspicious as hell.
Time to look it up. I found this in Ubuntu bugs: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/643899"><code>Firefox sending header &quot;Accept-Language: chrome://global/locale/intl.properties&quot;</code></a>.</p>
<p>Well&hellip; the bug was filed in 2010. By the way, Coursera was founded in 2012 lol.</p>
<p>Anyway, I guess I&rsquo;ve been affected by the bug very long because I have been using Firefox Sync to sync my preferences everywhere on new computers, effectively perpetuating the bug to myself.
Also, I never thought of trying out Coursera when I just finished setting up a VM either, so I never tried a real clean Firefox on Coursera.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t really need to figure out where the <code>chrome://global/locale/intl.properties</code> value came from. Let&rsquo;s just remove it!</p>
<p>Go to <code>about:config</code>, look for <code>intl.accept_languages</code>, click the <code>reset</code> button &hellip;and Coursera website can load just fine in Firefox now! The value of <code>intl.accept_languages</code> shown in <code>about:config</code> now is:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>en-US, en
</code></pre><p>Next question: Why only Coursera? For the real answer, go ask Coursera folks, of course.</p>
<p>My best guess is that they have their own custom web server and it considers that <code>chrome://global/locale/intl.properties</code> value in <code>accept-language</code> as suspicious and rejects it immediately. Or maybe it tries to parse that value and failed miserably lol.</p>
<p>Or&hellip; Wait, the error message earlier said something about Cloudflare, so maybe it&rsquo;s something about that instead. Well, I don&rsquo;t want to dig further. Bye!</p>
