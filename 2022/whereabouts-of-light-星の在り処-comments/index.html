            <p>Whereabouts of Light, or 星の在り処 (hoshi no arika), is the ending song of Trails in the Sky FC. There will be spoilers in this post, you have been warned.</p>
<p>Players get to hear this song in many places in Sky. From the initial opening scene of Sky FC, somewhere in mid-game of both Sky FC and SC, the full song at the end of Sky FC, and hell, even the tune you hear when the &lsquo;Falcom&rsquo; logo is shown when you boot up the Sky FC game is actually part of the full song.</p>

<p>The song itself has a role to play in the story. At the end of FC, when you can hear the harmonica version of the song playing in the background in the palace, if you talk with Olivier Lenheim before meeting up with Joshua, Olivier will tell you a bit about the song. Here is the conversation:</p>
<pre><code>Olivier: Oh-ho. 'tis young Joshua's performance, is it not?
Olivier: I heard him playing by the lake, but this...this is not mere playing, it's the weaving of the melody; the chisel of a sculptor or brush of a painter!
Olivier: He's been practicing, I surmise.
Estelle: He did play a lot when he was a kid.
Estelle: He played other songs, but this was the one he'd always come back to.
Olivier: Was it, now...?
Olivier: It's quite a surprise to hear Joshua play such a delicately beautiful yet obscure song.
Olivier: There are few enough Imperials who still remember it, much less Liberlians!
Estelle: Wait, so it's...an Erebonian song?
Olivier: Indeed. 'The Whereabouts of Light.'
Olivier: A very old Erebonian melody.
Olivier: A perennial favourite of the country folk, in fact.
Estelle: Wow. I had no idea...
</code></pre>
<p>Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://youtu.be/5J5SIBrZ0H8?t=638">a YouTube video</a> for that scene.</p>
<p>Anyway, so, an Erebonian song, popular with the country folk, but&hellip; also obscure? So, which is it, obscure or popular? Maybe obscure for Erebonian in general but popular only with the country folk? I don&rsquo;t know. Anyway, moving on.</p>
<p>In Trails of Cold Steel 1, Chapter 6, this song was mentioned by Misty in &lsquo;Abend Time&rsquo;, a radio talk show in Trista that Rean listens to in his dorm. This is what she said about it:</p>
<pre><code>...
Misty: But as far as music goes, I'm a sucker for the classics. I still sing along whenever I hear 'The Whereabouts of Light.'
Misty: I stare in disbelief... As you fade away... Like a dimming star... Beneath the coming day...
Misty: ...Heehee. Whoa, there! Almost felt like I was in my shower back home.
...
</code></pre>
<p>Well, the lyrics sang here are definitely a translation issue. It was sang totally incorrectly too, but, well, that&rsquo;s the limit of translations I guess. Ideally this part shouldn&rsquo;t have been translated, but well, it would be weird to have only this part of the game untranslated.</p>
<p>I found a YouTube video with the Japanese voiceacting (<a href="https://youtu.be/g78mjekflsc?t=2529">this one</a>), and actually, she sang the first line of the song (correctly):</p>
<pre><code>君の影星のように　朝に溶けて消えていく
    kimi no kage hoshi no you ni asa ni tokete kiete yuku
</code></pre>
<p>Since Misty mentions this song casually in Abend Time (I guess with some expectations that the audiences will know about the song), maybe it&rsquo;s actually supposed to be a popular song, not obscure at all. Maybe some translation errors in Sky FC, but I&rsquo;m too lazy to hunt for the Japanese version of the scene on YouTube. Or maybe an actual error in the script, I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<h2 id="lyrics">Lyrics</h2>
<h3 id="comments">Comments</h3>
<p>I posted (well, copy-and-pasted) the full lyrics <a href="/2022/whereabouts-of-light-%E6%98%9F%E3%81%AE%E5%9C%A8%E3%82%8A%E5%87%A6-lyrics/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the song having a significance in the story, it seems like the lyrics were written to match the ending of Sky FC (the separation of Estelle and Joshua), from Estelle&rsquo;s perspective. This is understandable, of course, to make the ending as soul-crushing as possible for the players.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have many comments about the lyrics here. They are mostly about separation and the hope to meet again one day. There&rsquo;s also a slight hint about the circumstances in Sky FC where Estelle being mostly carefree while Joshua knowing the situation a bit more:</p>
<pre><code>さよならを知らないで　夢見たのは一人きり
あの頃の君の目には　何が映っていたの？
</code></pre>
<h3 id="translation-nitpicks">Translation Nitpicks</h3>
<p>There are a few things about the English translations I copied that I want to nitpick:</p>
<pre><code>孤独とか痛みとか　どんな君も感じたい
もう一度見つめ合えれば　願いはきっと叶う
    Be it loneliness or pain, I want to feel you no matter what.
    If we can look each other in the eyes once more, our wish will surely come true.
</code></pre>
<p>I prefer to translate this to:</p>
<pre><code>孤独とか痛みとか　どんな君も感じたい
もう一度見つめ合えれば　願いはきっと叶う
    I want to feel you, regardless of if you are (currently) lonely or in pain.
    If only we can look at each other again... surely the wish will come true.
</code></pre>
<p>&lsquo;The wish&rsquo; here referring to the &lsquo;be able to look at each other again&rsquo; part.</p>
<p>Here is another nitpick:</p>
<pre><code>愛してるただそれだけで　二人はいつかまた会える
    I love you, it's that simple, so the two of us will be able to meet again.
</code></pre>
<p>I prefer to translate it to:</p>
<pre><code>愛してるただそれだけで　二人はいつかまた会える
    I love you, just that.
    The two of us will one day meet again.
</code></pre>
