            <p>Synology Router Manager (SRM) is the name of web interface to manage your
Synology Router RT2600ac device. For me, my SRM address is configured as
<code>http://router.synology.com:8000/webman/index.cgi</code>.</p>
<p>Recently, when I opened it on Firefox, I got an error page saying something
like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>An error occurred during a connection to router.synology.com:8000. PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR
</code></pre><p>I was able to open it just fine on Chrome, so it seemed that Firefox screwed
up somewhere.</p>
<p>Upon further examination, I noticed that on Firefox, I was redirected to HTTPS,
so I was actually visiting <code>https://router.synology.com:8000/webman/index.cgi</code>.</p>
<p>I confirmed that the <code>Automatically redirect HTTP connections to HTTPS</code> and
<code>Enable HSTS</code> checkboxes in SRM Control Panel were both NOT checked, so why was
this happening?</p>
<p>Turns out, there is a totally-not-new concept of HSTS preloading, apparently
<a href="https://www.chromium.org/hsts/">started in Chrome</a>, but
<a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2012/11/01/preloading-hsts/">Firefox has followed suit</a>.
Taking a look at the list preloaded by Firefox (available
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security">here</a>,
look for <code>nsSTSPreloadList.inc</code>), seems like synology.com is included in the
list.</p>
<p>So, maybe Firefox considers <code>router.synology.com:8000</code> the same as <code>synology.com</code>?
Anyway, the fix is clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open up <code>about:config</code></li>
<li>Find <code>network.stricttransportsecurity.preloadlist</code></li>
<li>Flip it to <code>false</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Done! Shamelessly stolen from <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54559584/253890">this StackOverflow answer</a>.</p>
<p>Note: This was Firefox 76.0.1 and Chrome 81.0.4044.138 respectively.</p>
